# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project was meant to hemp teach me the basics of j-query, bootstrap and dayjs. I started with some beginner code. I added more hour elements and all of the JavaScript functionality. This project compares the hour elements to the current time and edits their classes as you update the page. The page also saves data in the 6AM element in local storage and saves when you reload the page. However, I was unable to get the rest of the save buttons to work.

## Usage

The user can input and save a schedule while viewing what time is past, present, and future on a 24-hour clock.
